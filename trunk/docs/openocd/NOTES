Notes on OpenOCD:

You should run ./bootstrap first (for some reason)

I had to modify openocd.c's #define OPENOCD_VERSION to get it to work;
I removed the PKGBLDDATE and PKGBLDREV items from the #define

Run with:
./configure --enable-jlink

You also need to provide usb.h and libusb. On my Mac, these are in 
/opt/local/include and /opt/local/lib. One way to get them is to

CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include
LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib

export CFLAGS
export LDFLAGS

Then

./configure --enable-jlink

Make should then work fine.
