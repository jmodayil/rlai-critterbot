A little guide to units in the simulator
by Marc G. Bellemare

General
----------
Time is in MILLIseconds !! There is a good reason for this, but we may want
  to discuss it further.

Kinematics
----------
Mass is in kg
Moment of inertia is in kg m^2
Position is in m
Velocity is in m/s
Forces are in N
Angular velocity is in rad/s
Torque is in ..?


Omnidrive
---------
The x, y velocities are in ..?
The theta velocity is in ..?
The wheel velocities are in ..?
(these will have to be sync'd with the robot)
